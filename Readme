## 🔍 What Makes This Project Awesome?

- **Realistic Fraud Scenarios Covered**  
  - 💰 Transactions above $220 flagged as suspicious  
  - 🏪 Terminals compromised for 28 days detected automatically  
  - 👤 Customer fraud with inflated amounts over 14-day periods uncovered

- **Multiple ML Models, All Tuned & Ready**  
  Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression & Gradient Boosting — choose your champion!

- **Balanced Dataset Handling**  
  SMOTE oversampling tackles pesky class imbalances for better fraud detection.

- **Comprehensive Metrics & Visual Insights**  
  Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC — all visualized for quick understanding and confident decisions.

- **Flexible & Scalable**  
  Supports single file or multi-file `.pkl` datasets. Easily adapted to your environment.

## 📂 Dataset Structure

Organize your data in a folder called `data/` with `.pkl` files named by date, for example:

data/
├── 2018-09-14.pkl
├── 2018-09-15.pkl
├── ...


Each `.pkl` file contains transaction logs with these columns (essential!):

| Column         | Description                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| TRANSACTION_ID | Unique transaction identifier        |
| TX_DATETIME    | Timestamp of transaction             |
| CUSTOMER_ID    | Customer identifier                  |
| TERMINAL_ID    | Terminal or merchant identifier     |
| TX_AMOUNT      | Transaction amount in USD            |
| TX_FRAUD       | Fraud flag (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)   |
